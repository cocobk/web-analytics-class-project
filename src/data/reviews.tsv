34071682	New York, NY	Great location, easy check in and friendly staff. Just room a bit small but again the location cover that detail!
34071682	New York, NY	Rooms are smaller than they appear but they aight.
34071682	New York, NY	Great location and very stylish boutique hotel. I’d absolutely stay here again
34071682	New York, NY	Great stay! Cozy room, perfect for my boyfriend and I. Check in and check out were quick and easy. Will definitely book again!
34071682	New York, NY	Enjoyed the hotel, great staff and the aesthetic was better than what I expected. Will definitely be back for another stay!!
34071682	New York, NY	Arlo SoHo is a steal! This place was way nicer than the price tag suggested. Location was perfect, staff were friendly and helpful, and the rooms (tho a bit small but that’s NYC for you) were clean, comfortable, modern and had great views! The rooftop, lounge area, courtyard and the market were an added bonus and we were able to get drinks at the bar or champagne at the market which was very convenient! 10/10 would recommend and would stay here again!
34071682	New York, NY	Great rooms for outstanding price. The hotel is stylish and quaint, with cozy lounges, restaurants and bars. Check in was simple and the rooms were very clean. I loved our view of the courtyard with outdoor lights and rustic cabins, occupancies by an artistic graffiti art wall. Best place to not spend a fortune but still stay in a comfy bed. Right in Soho, walking distance from shops, restaurants and the Museum of Ice Cream!! Would stay again.
34071682	New York, NY	100% recommended! Everything was perfect. Thank you!
34071682	New York, NY	I enjoy my stay at ArloSoHo. Great staff/clean room/comfortable bed/quiet-peaceful surroundings...
34071682	New York, NY	Amazing experience! Highly reccomend.
34071682	New York, NY	If you need a place to sleep and that’s it maybe come here or maybe don’t. This place is like a dressed up hostel with a lot of outlets. Also the somewhat erotic  kangaroo statue in the common area is the weirdest thing I’ve ever seen and should be talked about LOL. Never again Arlo
34071682	New York, NY	great location- close to the subway and right next to so many great eateries. the room was exactly like pictured and for the price, i have a hard time commenting on any issues. only problems that we faced:1. did not know about the $100 deposit at check-in; luckily it wasn’t an issue but it may be for others. 2. water from the bathroom faucet was milky white, but some friends from the area said it is likely just a result of too much oxygen, not harmful. 3. if you ever want a bottled water or a small snack, you’d better have lots of extra spending money. A water was around $9, small canned soda water about  $7, pre-packaged tomato motz sandwich $15. This may be expected for a boutique hotel in SoHo, but we found ourselves pretty thirsty. Considering the price, last-minute booking, location, and city, I would definitely come again and recommend! (Might just bring a few water bottles next time!)
34071682	New York, NY	Great overall
34071682	New York, NY	my stay was short but very comfortable
34071682	New York, NY	Awesome  hotel  very clean.  Great  service
34071682	New York, NY	Very hard to contact host
34071682	New York, NY	Really clean
34071682	New York, NY	10/10. The place was amazing super clean, friendly staff. Chill vibe. Harolds is amazing. Close to Soho excellent view of the city from the room
34071682	New York, NY	Great value and location. I loved Arlo Soho and will definitely stay here again.
34071682	New York, NY	Great hotel will be back! Super cozy and at a price point you cannot beat. The hotel cabin cafe, lounge and rooftop are gorgeous. Only disappointing factors were the low quality shower curtains and tiny mini fridge.
34071682	New York, NY	overall clean and nice service.  good price and safe area of the city.
34071682	New York, NY	Loved it
34071682	New York, NY	Loved it , definitely worth every penny!
34071682	New York, NY	So nice weekend with Arlo. Amazing location, quiet place. And beautiful interior! Thanks
34071682	New York, NY	Loved my stay here. Would definitely stay again
34071682	New York, NY	The best location to be in NYC. For the price, you can’t really beat it. The room is really small but that was expected. A few complaints that I have is that housekeeping did not clean our room throughout our entire stay, unsure why; Difficult to reach front desk; and lastly just wished the hospitality by staff members were a little better. Otherwise, it was a decent stay.
34071682	New York, NY	Great experience
34071682	New York, NY	Beautiful and comfortable and completely worth it for the price
34071682	New York, NY	Can’t really review
34071682	New York, NY	Very small room you can’t even walk around your bed and bathroom are not well cleaned
34071682	New York, NY	No garaje.  Little room
34071682	New York, NY	Great place.
34071682	New York, NY	Amazing!!
34071682	New York, NY	Great stay, very comfortable and welcoming. We’ll be back
34071682	New York, NY	Great value
34071682	New York, NY	Always s great stay at arlo
34071682	New York, NY	Nice stay, very quiet, small room perfect for you and your partner. I love the standup shower and the sink outside of the bathroom. The mini fridge could’ve been bigger but meh. Really clean and beautiful hotel room. I’ve seen a few of you saying that the blonde reception lady I was rude & can confirm thats true. Oh also be aware they put a $100 dollar hold in your card at the front desk prior to check in, there was NO note of that no where on the listing smh but honestly I would come back its a very quiet and cozy bedroom. I really liked this hotel especially for the price. The rooftop and courtyard were closed so I didn’t get to enjoy all the hotel had to offer.
34071682	New York, NY	Great  place  to stay.
34071682	New York, NY	Great spot!
34071682	New York, NY	Honestly, if you’re looking for a stay downtown, this is it! Better than hotels and same price as Motels.
34071682	New York, NY	I had a perfect stay at arlo soho in NYC! I recommend for everyone who is visiting the city!!! Everything was so clean and the room that we got it was perfect for 2 people.Thank you very much!
34071682	New York, NY	Staff is friendly, accommodating, understanding, and the place is so clean and smells pleasant.
34071682	New York, NY	Great stay
34071682	New York, NY	Absolutely incredible, check every box.
34071682	New York, NY	Great location close to Soho and near trains/citi bikes. Room service provided upon request because of COVID regulations. Front desk employees are super friendly.
34071682	New York, NY	I appreciate that staff at ArloSoHo recognizes me upon arrival(I spent most of the summer there due to work). Rooms are always clean/staff is always hospitable/accommodating. A highly recommended stay!
34071682	New York, NY	The Arlo is a fantastic place to stay for couples looking to vacation on a smaller budget. My partner and I loved the very modern and stylish presentation of the hotel, and our room was incredibly comfortable and had everything we needed! The staff took every COVID precaution, and our room as well as the hotel entirely was incredibly clean. Despite the pandemic, I felt very safe and had a wonderful stay at the Arlo!
34071682	New York, NY	Arlo SoHo was very accommodating and met all of our needs. The workers were very welcoming upon arrival and throughout the stay. Its spot is very convenient being nearby a variety of public transportation options. It is also a great place to do work if you intend to work/study during your stay. The room provides a work desk that folds open while the building has a first floor lounge and rooftop which is very convenient for working professionals. I would definitely come back again!
34071682	New York, NY	Beautiful clean space
34071682	New York, NY	Our stayed was amazing! It was perfect for us. Don’t let the “tiny” fool you. It’s design sparked a lot of conversations between us. We admired the design and the thought it was put into everything. Really loved it.
17344027	New York, NY	Good place for a quick trip. Bed was kind of hard to sleep on. Room is very small I wouldn’t bring too much or stay for long periods of time. Walls are extremely thin I could hear everything from the room next door and apartments above. Excellent location however. Great hosts that provide the spaces you need for your belongings and adequate response time. Overall it was a nice stay.
17344027	New York, NY	Great communication from hosts and super clear directions for all aspects of your stay, both before and throughout. They have reserved spaces in the bathroom and kitchen and provide easy references to know exactly what’s there for you. The bathroom amenities are fantastic - the shower is amazing and the toilet is fancy (at least it was to me), made for really nice added value. The room has a great setup and everything you need for a comfortable stay, assuming you plan on being out and exploring the city more than staying in! Perfect for sleeping and stopping back in between trips out to refresh.
17344027	New York, NY	Great room, in a great area
17344027	New York, NY	Hosts were very accommodating and friendly. The pictures were pretty accurate. I will say that the room is only good for one person because the space is fairly small which is to be expected considering it’s NYC. I really appreciated it’s close proximity to places you might want to see while visiting the city.
17344027	New York, NY	This place was definitely in a great location! The hosts were amazing! Responded fairly quickly to questions and messages. Would definitely recommend! The shower is AMAZING!
17344027	New York, NY	Great space. Exceptionally clean. I will be returning!!!
17344027	New York, NY	My stay here was really clean and comfortable. All of the hosts are super communicative and the apartment itself was clean and true to the pictures. The location in Chelsea is also really great, I liked that it was close to Chelsea piers, but not to far from subway stations. Thanks for a great stay!
17344027	New York, NY	I totally recommend this spot if you’re visiting NYC! I self quarantined here for a few days after arriving to the city and it was really convenient and accurate to the description. Would stay here again.
17344027	New York, NY	Pass on this one.
17344027	New York, NY	Great location and a clean, quiet place.
17344027	New York, NY	Location was great and accessible. This was the best stay I’ve ever had at an Airbnb. Beyond the space itself equipped with a lovely kitchen and bathroom, the room was very nice and relaxing with an AC and all. Definitely would stay here again.
17344027	New York, NY	Expect a bit more than what's advertised!
17344027	New York, NY	I quarantined here for a week and it was a really great location for this!  In walking distance to the Hudson riverfront as well as the village and almost anywhere else. Reece is a doll and was both fun and helpful. I enjoyed the other Airbnb guests. Kitchen is functional and Japanese toilet is awesome. I would absolutely stay here again. Thanks for a great stay!
17344027	New York, NY	This location is in the heart of Chelsea and just a block up from the subway or the west city trail for bikers or runners.  I went to bike NYC and I found this location to be amazing being that it was a two blocks up from the Chelsea pier which is a perfect place to have a picnic,  walk, or get on the trail.  The room was comfy and there was an ac in the room you coul control.  The room has a large window which lets in tons of light so keep that in mind if you like to sleep late.  I liked that the provided ear plugs for outside noise, being that you do hear some cars and people walking on the street in the morning.  It was also nice that they had a drawer in the fridge and bathroom to store your items.  I would love to stay here again.
17344027	New York, NY	This was such a great place. Daniel is the best host ever. The bathroom and kitchen was gorgeous. Will recommend to anyone.
17344027	New York, NY	Clean!
17344027	New York, NY	Very nice place, highly recommended!
17344027	New York, NY	The place is clean and nice. There are so many grocery places and restaurants around.
17344027	New York, NY	Excellent location. Cozy rooms. Prime example of New York City living.
17344027	New York, NY	This stay restored my faith in airbnb thank you
17344027	New York, NY	Chelsea is such a cute area, and the hosts are quite kind and welcoming. The apartment is immaculately clean and the bathroom is sooo nice! It has a shower with like 5 different heads! I think I probably looked hilarious trying to figure it out the first time but once I figured it out it was very fancy and nice :)
17344027	New York, NY	Súper easy to check in. Great communication and response times. Location is excellent and in a great neighborhood. Place is clean and comfortable. Would definitely recommend
17344027	New York, NY	Very nice place. Very well located, safe neighborhood with good restaurants and shops nearby and with easy access to subway and bus. I had to walk alone sometimes late at night and I didn’t feel uncomfortable or threatened, nice people in the neighborhood. Hosts were helpful and attentive! House was clean and organized. I had one question about the shower one day and the host promptly responded to my messages, helping me as quickly as possible. Super nice place to stay while in New York City!!
17344027	New York, NY	Great location! All hosts were very attentive to any questions asked and allowed early check in and let us leave our bags in the apartment past check out. Really appreciate the flexibility.
17344027	New York, NY	Daniel was a fantastic host to us. I would recommend this place to my friends visiting NYC.
17344027	New York, NY	This is a fantastic location. I highly recommend a morning coffee just down the road on 15th st. at Terremoto Coffee. Real coffee, real people! Literally around the corner from the apartment is Blossom, delicious, fine dining vegan food for lunch or dinner. Daniel’s place is basic, clean and lovely. Everything you need, even some umbrellas to borrow should the weather be moody. From booking to key collection to location, was well described by this super host. At the end we even got recommendations for luggage storage should we need it after check out. Which we did and the recommendation was spot on! You can’t go wrong here people!
17344027	New York, NY	The place is clean and just as described.
17344027	New York, NY	Everything about this place is so great. Instructions on everything are clear. I enjoyed my stay there.
17344027	New York, NY	A great room in a beautiful part of town. Comfortable bed and thoughtful amenities (sound machine, ear plugs, etc.) for the sometimes noisy city.
17344027	New York, NY	Had a great stay here! Shane responded quickly to all my inquiries and check-in was super easy. The location was ideal and safe with grocery and drug stores nearby. Would recommend this apartment to my friends and family.
17344027	New York, NY	Daniel's place was clean, stylish, and peaceful. Super easy check-in and check-out - be prepared to walk ~5 min to pick up and drop off keys. The area is safe and very conveniently located, close to 1/2 and A/C trains so all of Manhattan is accessible. Finally, privacy was not at all a concern - there are other guests as well as the host, but common areas are spacious and bedroom doors are able to be locked (although only from the inside). Highly recommended if you are in town for work or pleasure!
17344027	New York, NY	Great spot with the easiest check-in process of all time. Definitely recommend.
17344027	New York, NY	Great place to stay in the city. Highly recommend.
17344027	New York, NY	A clean, stylish space in a fantastic neighborhood. KeyCafe works great for picking up and dropping off the keys. Easy access to the High Line and plenty of entertainment and dining options within a short walking distance. Would definitely stay there again.
17344027	New York, NY	I stayed for one night and enjoyed the experience. I met Colin when I arrived, he was very nice and friendly. The place is clean and stylish. Please keep in mind the apt is on a second floor and there is no elevator so pack light))
17344027	New York, NY	good
17344027	New York, NY	Great location and place. it has everything one may need to spend some time in NYC. I’d definitely stay here again. 
17344027	New York, NY	Location, cleanliness, friendly host.. I can't think of any negatives. Even if the footprint of the room was small, it works well with plenty of space under the bed to push a suitcase under.
17344027	New York, NY	Great value great neighborhood
17344027	New York, NY	Great stay.  Location was primo and the space as was described. Communication was clear and timely. No problems with heat on a winters evening.  
17344027	New York, NY	Very thorough in instructions. Great location. Cute interior.
17344027	New York, NY	This place is in an awesome building, great location, and super clean. The hosts are wonderful, we were so busy we didn't ever run into anyone but they messaged everyday to see if we needed anything. I highly recommend these hosts and this apartment.
17344027	New York, NY	HI Everyone,My  daughter stayed with Dan, Simon and Shane in the Chelsea location from May 15 - August 12, 2017.  She was a summer intern for the Today show at NBC.  Her experience was amazing at the Today show and with the Air BnB.    (Julia stayed at NYU last summer for another internship and their is NO comparison.)  This was the same price and we did not have to  basically restock a dorm room for 12 weeks, there was wireless, and it was  exceptionally clean. (The bathroom is amazing.)  I had a million questions as we were making the decision and Shane answered every single one, promptly.  Julia was safe and secure, she met some amazing people this summer at the Air B N B and her life was enriched.  The internship required her to leave as early as 3:45 am and occasionally return very late at night.  There were no safety issues.  (Shane, Dan and Simon checked on her frequently and on the occasional bumpy day , they were right there. ) This place is a gem and I know that Shane, Dan and Simon will be Julia's friends for life.   We truly are filled with gratitude.  THANK YOU!!!!!
17344027	New York, NY	I've stayed in a lot of hotels, and I've worked for international luxury hotels, so my expectations are high but reasonable. This was my first airbnb, and I was absolutely delighted. Clean. Upscale design details. Clear communication from the hosts throughout the stay. The host went above and beyond to ensure I felt welcomed, provided me with great tips for exploring the city, and the minor requests I had were quickly resolved. By the end of my visit, I felt as though I was staying at a dear friend's home rather than a stranger's. I would highly recommend this to anyone who appreciates high attention to detail, proactive communication and access to great NYC tips.Thank you Simon, Shane and Dan for ensuring my trip to NYC was memorable and fun! 
17344027	New York, NY	The room was really clean and comfortable. There were some guides for how to use that place , it helps well. The location is nice to go Chelsy market and quite place . Easy to contact with host and especially I was impressed the day before we got snow storm. They told me to prepare for it and some good stores. Thank you guys !! I really recommend this room :) 
17344027	New York, NY	Great place with great location. place was clean. checkin was super simple. Would book again.
17344027	New York, NY	The host was very responsive. The whole apartment is very nice, clean and it's comfortable place to stay. Would totally recommend it to anyone.
17344027	New York, NY	Nice stay in the room! The location is really great.
17344027	New York, NY	Great location, excellent communication and very easy check-in/out process. Very happy to have chosen this spot, would highly recommend!
17344027	New York, NY	the room looks bigger on the photos.  Big suitcases hardly have room.  but with hand luggage and only a short time, it is sufficient.  the location is very good and the information by mail.  on the whole we were rather disappointed
